# FortNight
HackDuke Fall 2015 project:  
A web application for bimonthly schedule planning. Fortnight prioritizes the importance of your activities based on its relevance to your health. Users can adjust the settings of their schedule day-by-day by customizing class times, extracurricular activities, and time dedicated to basic functions such as eating and sleeping. Priority setting allows for adjustment to different "phases" in life such as emergency phase for midterms which temporarily allow less sleep on the calendar.
